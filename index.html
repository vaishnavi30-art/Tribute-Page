                <h2>Teresa of Calcutta</h2>
                <p><b>Mother Teresa</b>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, MC, better known as Mother Teresa, was an Indian-Albanian Catholic 
                nun who, in 1950, founded the Missionaries of Charity. Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu was born in Skopje—at the time,
                part of the Ottoman Empire.After eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived most 
                of her life. Saint Teresa of Calcutta[b] was canonised on 4 September 2016. The anniversary of her death is her
                feast day. After Mother Teresa founded her religious congregation, it grew to have over 4,500 nuns and was
                active in 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS,
                leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's
                and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty,
                and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.
                "[7]Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979
                 Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many
                for her charitable work. She was praised and criticised on various counts, such as for her views on abortion
                and contraception, and was criticized for poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorized biography
                was written by Navin Chawla and published in 1992, and she has been the subject of other books as well as films.</p>
